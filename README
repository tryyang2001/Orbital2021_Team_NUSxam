Milestone 2:

To try out the application, download the NUSxam.zip file. Unzip the file, and find the NUSxam_v1.exe inside the folder. Please do not delete other files inside. You may need to 
disable your antivirus when running the application. The application is totally safe, do not worry! :)

Unfortunately, our application is built using a window form application. Although it is .Net Core, it does not allow running on macOS.
