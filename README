Milestone 3:

The application is built using a window form application. Although it is .Net Core, it does not allow running on macOS.

To try out the application on Windows, download the NUSxam.zip file. Unzip the file, and find the NUSxam_v1.exe inside the folder. Please do NOT delete other files inside. 
Internet connection is needed for NUSxam.
You may need to disable your antivirus when running the application. The application is totally safe, do not worry! ;)
