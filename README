NUSxam (CP2106 Orbital Project)

The application is built using a window form application. Although it is .Net Core, it does not allow running on macOS.

To try out the application on Windows, download the NUSxam.zip file. Unzip the file, and find the NUSxam_v1.exe inside the folder. Please do NOT delete other files inside. 
Internet connection is needed for NUSxam.
You may need to disable your antivirus when running the application. The application is totally safe, do not worry! ;)

Take note that for laptops with aspect ratio 16:9, the best resolution is 125%. 
For laptops with aspect ratio 16:10, the best resolution is 150%. 
If you encountered any problem of displaying issues, do consider changing the resolution. 

We uses free version of Azure database system, which would expires someday and then the application might not work anymore.
